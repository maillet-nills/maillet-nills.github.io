# 🗂️ Personal Portfolio – Nills Maillet

![Portfolio preview](images/portfolio_preview.png)

This portfolio is a personal project built to showcase my work, skills, and tech watch.
Developed with a modern frontend stack, it uses **Supabase** as a PostgreSQL backend to dynamically load content without rebuilding the site.
Hosted on **GitHub Pages**, it reflects my approach to clean, maintainable, and scalable web development.
